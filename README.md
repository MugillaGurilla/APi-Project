### Definitions of Done and Ready

##### Definition of Done for API testing

* [ ] Thorough test coverage
* [ ] Repeatable tests
* [ ] Isolated tests that test single unit
* [ ] Easily readable tests - even non-technical can understand them.

##### Definition of Done for the Presentation

* [ ] Slides are well designed, with concise, accurate information
* [ ] Presenters know their slides well enough to discuss them without a script
* [ ] Multimedia such as living documentation, videos and graphs are used
* [ ] Use of text is minimal
* [ ] Retrospective has been completed and findings are present within slides.

##### Definition of Ready

User Stories:

* [ ] Immediately actionable
* [ ] Negotiated and agreed upon by all
* [ ] Valuable User Stories i.e. Users paths with most coverage or business value are given priority
* [ ] Estimatable i.e. expected response can be estimated
* [ ] Small
* [ ] Testable

HTTP Client:
* [ ] Dependencies
* [ ] Easy to read

Framework: 
* [ ] Extendable

##### And the project must have:

* [ ] Individual test cases written
* [ ] A ready-to-use Testing Framework
