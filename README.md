### Framework instructions

How the framework functions:

above class diagram should explain how the framework functions

### Definitions of Done and Ready

##### Definition of Done for API testing

* [ ] Thorough test coverage
* [x] Repeatable tests
* [ ] Isolated tests that test single unit
* [x] Easily readable tests - even non-technical can understand them.

##### Definition of Done for the Presentation

* [ ] Slides are well designed, with concise, accurate information
* [ ] Presenters know their slides well enough to discuss them without a script
* [ ] Multimedia such as living documentation, videos and graphs are used
* [ ] Use of text is minimal
* [ ] Retrospective has been completed and findings are present within slides.

##### Definition of Ready

User Stories:

* [x] Immediately actionable
* [x] Negotiated and agreed upon by all
* [x] Valuable User Stories i.e. Users paths with most coverage or business value are given priority
* [x] Estimatable i.e. expected response can be estimated
* [x] Small
* [x] Testable

HTTP Client:
* [ ] Dependencies
* [ ] Easy to read

Framework: 
* [x] Extendable

##### And the project must have:

* [x] Individual test cases written
* [x] A ready-to-use Testing Framework
