### Framework

<img src="readme-assets/services%20class%20diagram.png" alt="Services Class Diagram" width=800>

### How the framework functions

There are three folders within the project, DataHandling, HttpManager and Services. Broadly speaking, the **DataHandling** folder
deals with deserialising JSON responses into C# objects, **HttpManager** deals with making API requests, but only in a generic sense.
**Services** is more granular and details the actual nuances of a Spell, Monster or DnD Class service.

A goal of this framework was to keep everything generic right up until the point where it could no longer be, allowing the frameowrk
to be extensible.

### DataHandling

Within the Models folder, there are C# object definitions for the each service. `DTO.cs` uses Newtonsoft to deserialise API responses from JSON to
a C# object. For example, `DndClass.cs` calls `CallManager.cs` which deserialises to a `DndClassReponse.cs` object. `IResponse.cs` is
merely used to implement generic types, see line 6 of `DTO.cs`

```
public class DTO<T> where T : IResponse, new()
```

### HttpManager

This class utilises HttpClient to actually execute an API request. The `MakeARequestAsync` function ultimately returns the JSON
response as an unformatted string. This is then turned into a JObject and the relevant C# object.

### Services

Some service behaviour is defined with `Services.cs` and `IService.cs` but service behaviour is fully fleshed out within the
individual classes of `DndClass.cs`, `Spell.cs` and `Monster.cs`. All of which inherit from IService and Services. The main goal of
`IService.cs` is to group all services together and implement generic types. MakeAServices() is an important function that allows
the tests to be reusable. It is utilised within the BDD folder in `SharedSteps.cs`. Ultimately, this allows the program to reuse the
same tests for many different API calls.

### SharedSteps.cs

The individual step definitions simply contain different Assert.That() functions. However, the heavy-lifting in regard to tests in `SharedSteps`.
To start a `Services` object and `IServices` interface are instantiated. Within the Then statement, the
`IService` interface is turned from a generic interface to specific service, becoming a Monster, Spell or DndClass service. The `section` argument
is key to this and is used within
an if statement in MakeAService() in `Services.cs`. With the service's full behaviour now defined, an API call is made using MakeARequestAsync().
